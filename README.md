### Kill all invaders!

- Control a red spaceship using either your mouse cursor or the arrow keys on your keyboard to move around within bottom of the screen.
- The Spacebar key on the keyboard or the left mouse button will shoot a beam from your ship at the enemies.
- There are orange barriers that prevent you from shooting up at the enemies from any position, you must move bvetween these pillars to get a shot off.
- If a green enemy passes your barriers you die and the game is over.
- A star screen with no barriers in which the user can move freely means you have won the game!
